# Credit-card-Fraud-Detection-with-SnapML
This is my second task as a machine learning intern at CodTech IT Solutions

Name: Kovuri Srujana

Company: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

ID: CT08DS6797

Domain: Machine Learning

Duration: August to September 2024

Mentor: Muzammil Ahmed

Project Title: Linear Regression on Housing Prices

# Overview of the Project:
This project demonstrates the use of Snap ML and scikit-learn for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using a Decision Tree Classifier. The dataset used in this project is a popular credit card fraud detection dataset available on Kaggle.

Fraud detection is a critical application of machine learning in the financial industry. In this project, we focus on the following:

Data Preprocessing: Scaling and normalization of the feature matrix to improve the performance of the machine learning model.

Handling Class Imbalance: The dataset is highly imbalanced, with fraudulent transactions being significantly less frequent than legitimate ones. We address this by computing sample weights.

Model Training: We train a Decision Tree Classifier using Snap ML, which offers optimized training routines with multi-threading support, resulting in faster model training compared to traditional scikit-learn implementations.

Model Evaluation: The performance of the model is evaluated using the ROC-AUC score, which provides insights into the model's ability to distinguish between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset, which can be downloaded from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).
